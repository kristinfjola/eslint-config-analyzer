# ESLint-config-analyzer

This is a tool that was created for an MSc project of Kristín Fjóla Tómasdóttir at Delft University of Technology, August 2017.

A number of 86,366 JavaScript projects are examined to analyze the prevalence of linter usage and further analyze all identified ESLint configuration files. These files are parsed to extract information on preset, plugin and rule usage.
